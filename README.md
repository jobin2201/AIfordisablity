# AI to Empower Persons with Disabilities Hackathon
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the "AI-Enabled Disability Assistance: Speak and Sign Assistant" project, developed as part of AI to Empower Persons with Disabilities Hackathon, a four-day bootcamp. This project focuses on empowering individuals with disabilities by leveraging cutting-edge AI technology to bridge communication gaps, providing real-time support for those with speech or hearing impairments.

The system facilitates two-way communication through:

Speech-to-Sign Conversion: Converts spoken language into sign language to assist the hearing-impaired in understanding conversations.
Sign-to-Speech Translation: Translates sign language gestures into speech, allowing the speech-impaired to communicate effectively with others.
By combining artificial intelligence with real-time sign and speech recognition, this project aims to enhance accessibility and inclusion in communication, offering a more independent and seamless experience for individuals with disabilities.
